# Final Project - itemLookup

## App Title:

itemLookup

## App Description:

Whenever you want to find  out what a certain item is, and where you can buy it, use the itemLookup app!

## Team:

Kyle Mamiit

## Inspiration:

I had an interesting class. A lot of factors led to me being one of the only students to attend class when it was scheduled. As a result, I had a lot of time to talk to one of the student TAs. He gave me an idea to utilize the features of the iPhone. He suggested using the camera feature on the iPhone to make an app that recognizes a playing card object and essentially counts cards. However, I did not really understand the concept of counting cards, but I liked the idea of using an object detector. I initially thought having an app that recognizes the exact, specific object would be amazing to pull off. However, the scope of it would be too long for me to handle. So, I just made a more generic app. It detects the object, captures it, and uses Ebay's API to search if it's available. This allows users to check if they can buy that general item.

## Challenges:

- Not Having access to my student TA's because they shut down the class

- Not having a group to rely on or to help me

- Taking this class in a quarter system that also started later when classes started. This essentially pushes the weeks back.

## What's Next?:

Hopefully, the next phase is to keep improving the app. I need to work on the design aspect and the functional aspect. I hope to one day figure out how to make the app capture a specific model of an object and find out where to buy that exact, specific item online.
